## API
Three different public APIs have been used for this project:
- [PICSUM](https://picsum.photos/) - Public API for random images. I've chosen a limit of one picture for page and I've shuffled the page, so you can get a random picture everytime.

- [RANDOMUSER](https://randomuser.me/) - Public API for the character part. The API gives you random user data and I've picked only three of them (name and surname, age and location).

- [QUOTABLE](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) - Public API repo for random inspirational quotes.
